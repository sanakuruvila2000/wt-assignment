<br>
    <h3 style="color:blue">A jewel nestled in Cochinâ€™s exquisite beauty, Taj Malabar Resort & Spa, Cochin enchants you with its lovely
 old-world charm combined with world class luxury services. Perched at the tip of the Willingdon Island, overlooking the harbour, 
you get the feeling of being cut off from the rest of the world, peacefully floating out towards the horizon. Open views of the
 harbour with the Chinese Fishing nets in the distance, make you feel welcomed; a beautiful start to a journey that only gets better 
at our 5 star hotel in Kochi.</h3>
